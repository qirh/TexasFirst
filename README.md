# Â¡Texas First! [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qirh/TexasFirst/master/LICENSE)

## Summary
  This is a simple [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/texas-first/cflpfjhdephkbknjgidjkcfhohbddlnh) that loops over all the option elements in dropdown menus and puts **TX** or **Texas**, at the top of the list if it finds it.

  **How it works:**
  * **Page Load:** the extension will look in storage for whether the user has set the extension to run or not. The default state is yes.
  * **Popup/Options page:**
    * Both pages are the same. The popup page can be accessed by pressing on the Texas flag and the options menu can be accessed either by right clicking or from the extensions page.
    * When the user turns on or off the extension, it  will save that preference in storage and will query storage for the information every-time the page comes up.
    * The main JavaScript file listens for the changes in storage and will on the page whenever the user turns on the extension.

  Find the extension in the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/texas-first/cflpfjhdephkbknjgidjkcfhohbddlnh).
