## Summary
  In picker menus: **Texas** & **TX** will load, in the place that only she deserves, at very top, #1  Nice for proud Texans and those of us ehm who are applying for jobs and hate scrolling down so much.

## How it works
  This is a pretty simple Chrome extension. Basically, it loops over all the option tags in the html page and if it detects any mention of "TX" or "Texas" it will first remove it from the list, then append it to the top. You can download it from the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/texas-first/cflpfjhdephkbknjgidjkcfhohbddlnh)
  Uses [JQuery](https://jquery.com) to manipulate the DOM. And also uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [Bootstrap-Switch](http://bootstrapswitch.com), [Bulma](http://bulma.io) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) for the pop-up menu.
